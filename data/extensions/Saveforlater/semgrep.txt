/home/codescan/save-for-later/popup/bootstrap.js:134:16:warning(detect-non-literal-regexp):          if (!new RegExp(o).test(s)):RegExp() called with a `n` function argument, this might allow an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) within your application as RegExP blocks the main thread. For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.
