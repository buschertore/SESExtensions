data/tempCode/jump-cutter/webpack.config.js:120:37:warning(path-join-resolve-traversal):      path: path.resolve(__dirname, `dist-${env.browser}`),:Detected possible user input going into a `path.join` or `path.resolve` function. This could possibly lead to a path traversal vulnerability,  where the attacker can access arbitrary files stored in the file system. Instead, be sure to sanitize or validate user input first.
