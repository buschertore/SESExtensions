/home/codescan/Discord-Token-Login/extension/content.js:27:36:warning(incomplete-sanitization):	localStorage.setItem('token', `"${discordtoken.replace('"', '')}"`);:`discordtoken.replace` method will only replace the first occurrence when used with a string argument ('"'). If this method is used for escaping of dangerous data then there is a possibility for a bypass. Try to use sanitization library instead or use a Regex with a global flag.
