This could possibly lead to a path traversal vulnerability,  where the attacker can access arbitrary files stored in the file system. Instead, be sure to sanitize or validate user input first.

data/tempCode/random-user-agent-switche/src/utils/patterns.ts:7:10:warning(detect-non-literal-regexp):  return new RegExp(`^${rule}$`, 'i').test(what):RegExp() called with a `pattern` function argument, this might allow an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) within your application as RegExP blocks the main thread. For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.
