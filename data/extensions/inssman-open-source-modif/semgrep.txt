For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.
