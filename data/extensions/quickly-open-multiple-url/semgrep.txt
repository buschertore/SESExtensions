data/tempCode/quickly-open-multiple-url/vue.config.js:16:28:warning(path-join-resolve-traversal):    template: path.resolve(`src/${name}/index.html`),:Detected possible user input going into a `path.join` or `path.resolve` function. This could possibly lead to a path traversal vulnerability,  where the attacker can access arbitrary files stored in the file system. Instead, be sure to sanitize or validate user input first.
