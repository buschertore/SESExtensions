I use it to understand what I am reading. It also allows for direct cut and paste by hovering over the kanji set, and pulling it over to a word document for further study. I use a self-made graph to help me with memorization. Blessed is technology. Learning kanji was much more time consuming before I started using this.\n\nJust one suggestion might be to correct the issue that sometimes it does not separate the kanji set into its elements.\n\nThank you so ...
