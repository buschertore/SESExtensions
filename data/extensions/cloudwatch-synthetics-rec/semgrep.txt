data/tempCode/cloudwatch-synthetics-rec/src/content-scripts/__tests__/helpers.js:28:59:warning(path-join-resolve-traversal):    app.use('/build', express.static(path.join(__dirname, buildDir))):Detected possible user input going into a `path.join` or `path.resolve` function. This could possibly lead to a path traversal vulnerability,  where the attacker can access arbitrary files stored in the file system. Instead, be sure to sanitize or validate user input first.
