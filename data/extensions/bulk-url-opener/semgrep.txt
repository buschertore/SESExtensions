data/tempCode/bulk-url-opener/app/js/utility.js:596:5:error(insecure-document-method):    div.innerHTML = str;:User controlled data in methods like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML` or `document.write` is an anti-pattern that can lead to XSS vulnerabilities
data/tempCode/bulk-url-opener/app/js/utility.js:450:19:warning(detect-non-literal-regexp):    const regex = new RegExp(`[?&]${name}(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)`, "i");:RegExp() called with a `name` function argument, this might allow an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) within your application as RegExP blocks the main thread. For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.
