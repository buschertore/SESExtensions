data/tempCode/adrium-easy-pass/test-env/browserAPI.js:17:58:warning(path-join-resolve-traversal):    return url.pathToFileURL(path.resolve(process.cwd(), ...filepath.split("/"))).href;:Detected possible user input going into a `path.join` or `path.resolve` function. This could possibly lead to a path traversal vulnerability,  where the attacker can access arbitrary files stored in the file system. Instead, be sure to sanitize or validate user input first.
