/home/codescan/Falcon/src/assets/js/owl/assignment.js:6:14:warning(detect-non-literal-regexp):    var re = new RegExp("([?&])" + key + "=.*?(&|$)", "i");:RegExp() called with a `key` function argument, this might allow an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) within your application as RegExP blocks the main thread. For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.
