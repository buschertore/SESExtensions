data/tempCode/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/app/options/components/TextareaInput.vue:3:9:warning(avoid-v-html):        <label :for="id" v-html="label"></label>:Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Only use HTML interpolation on trusted content and never on user-provided content.
data/tempCode/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/app/options/options.html:7:5:warning(missing-integrity):    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.materialdesignicons.com/5.3.45/css/materialdesignicons.min.css" />:This tag is missing an 'integrity' subresource integrity attribute. The 'integrity' attribute allows for the browser to verify that externally hosted files (for example from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. Without this attribute, if an attacker can modify the externally hosted resource, this could lead to XSS and other types of attacks. To prevent this, include the base64-encoded cryptographic hash of the resource (file) youâ€™re telling the browser to fetch in the 'integrity' attribute for all externally hosted files.
data/tempCode/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/app/scripts/service_worker.js:70:37:warning(detect-non-literal-regexp):  if (/^\/.*\/$/.test(glob)) return new RegExp(glob.replace(/^\/(.*)\/$/, '$1')):RegExp() called with a `glob` function argument, this might allow an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) within your application as RegExP blocks the main thread. For this reason, it is recommended to use hardcoded regexes instead. If your regex is run on user-controlled input, consider performing input validation or use a regex checking/sanitization library such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck to verify that the regex does not appear vulnerable to ReDoS.
