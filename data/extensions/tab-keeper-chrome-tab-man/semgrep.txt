data/tempCode/tab-keeper-chrome-tab-man/scripts/bump_version.cjs:7:19:info(unsafe-formatstring):    console.error(`Failed to execute ${command}`, error);:Detected string concatenation with a non-literal variable in a util.format / console.log function. If an attacker injects a format specifier in the string, it will forge the log message. Try to use constant values for the format string.
data/tempCode/tab-keeper-chrome-tab-man/scripts/bump_version.cjs:5:14:error(detect-child-process):    execSync(command, { stdio: 'inherit' });:Detected calls to child_process from a function argument `command`. This could lead to a command injection if the input is user controllable. Try to avoid calls to child_process, and if it is needed ensure user input is correctly sanitized or sandboxed.
